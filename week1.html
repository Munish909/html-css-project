        <p>
          Without a doubt the benchmark big luxury saloon, the one Audi, BMW,
          Lexus, Cadillac and even Jaguar and Maserati must define themselves by
          and be measured against. This car defines the sector and is the one
          all others must topple. The latest A8 and 7 Series are both much newer
          than the S and thus have some exceptionally clever tech on-board, but
          while both are excellent cars in their own right, neither is quite as
          special as the big Merc. A facelift in 2017 – this generation’s last
          before it’s replaced by an entirely new S-Class – gave many new
          things. Chief among them new engines, Merc’s latest-generation in-line
          six-cylinder diesels and petrols, plus a plug-in hybrid and the S63
          AMG’s V8 bi-turbo petrol. The rare-groove S65 is no more, but you can
          still get a V12-engined S-Class in the form of the super-luxe,
          super-rare and super-expensive £180,000 Mercedes-Maybach S650. This
          update also gave the S-Class an array of semi-autonomous driving
          technology like Active Speed Limit Assist, Active Lane Change Assist
          and Remote Parking Assist, most of which debuted in the E-Class. But
          to make sure the S-Class kept its crown as the techiest Merc, it got a
          few of its own too. The main one is a kind of active cruise control
          that, as well as sensing and maintaining gaps to other cars, knows to
          slow you for roundabouts, corners and tolls using GPS. Of course that
          particular system has been rolled out to other Mercs now, but it’s
          reasonable to expect much cleverness from the new S-Class, which could
          be revealed as soon as this year. Because this particular era of
          S-Class is so near the end of its life, Mercedes has massively cut
          back on the number of trim levels/equipment combinations if offers.
          Now there’s just one trim for the non-AMGs – ‘Grand Edition’ – and
          only the cheapest S350d is available with the short-wheelbase.
